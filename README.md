# Topic Modeling for Research Articles (A multilabel Classification ML Exercise)

Objective: To build a ML model which can classify the 
research articles based on their topics/subjects using the provided abstract and title details.

Data available: The research article abstracts and titles are sourced from the following topics: 
Computer Science, Physics, Mathematics, Statistics, Quantitative Biology, Quantitative Finance. 

Synopsis:                                                                   
•	Exploratory Data Analysis on text data like data cleaning, n-grams, WordClouds, Freq plots                               
•	Text mining and NLP techniques like wordtovec, TFIDF, CountVectorisation                          
•	Machine/Statistical learning techniques like Hyperparameter tuning, Cross validation, RandomizedSearchCV and GriddSearchCV                  

Outcome: A multi-label classification model with an accuracy of ~84%.                          

Achievement:
